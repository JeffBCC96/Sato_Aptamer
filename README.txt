Instruction of Aptamer Design1. In order to run Aptamer design successfully, a suitable environment is required. Please install the following tools at first: 		--- Vienna RNA		--- SPARCS		--- NUPACK   2. Run the python script: 	option 1: Run it with a fasta file/ gene bank file/ Gene ID			  Command: python APD.py NM_001294338 		    	      	option 2: Run it with a name (you provided) and a sequence			  Command: python APD.py name ACTGCACG...			  	Folder ¡°name¡± contains the following outputs: 		- Final result of designed aptamers (final_result)		- Blast result of the aptamers (info_species)		- Failed aptamers with reasons (failed_aptamers)		- Original input file (xx.fa/xx.gb)		- Input sequence (yourSeq.fa)		- Dinucleotide random sequences (name.fa)		- Uniform random sequences (name_ran.fa)		- Predicted segments (segmentsfile_name.txt)		- Z-score plot for dinucleotide modle (name_zplot.png)		- Z-score plot for uniform modle (name_zplotRan.png)3. Run with options:	If you want to use RNA alignment function to design aptamers unique to each of the similar RNAs, please follow the example here. 	python APD.py RNA_seq1 RNA_seq2 Seqname_1 Seqname_2 -a	Here RNA_seq1 means the first RNA sequence: AGTCGATCGTCTA¡­	     RNA_seq2 means the second RNA sequence: AGTCGATCGGGTG¡­             Seqname_1 and Seqname_2 are the names for sequence 1 and sequence 2 
	     which are optional. The default names are ¡®seq1¡¯, ¡®seq2¡¯
